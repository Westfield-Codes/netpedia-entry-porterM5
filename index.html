  <h2>Description:</h2> <p>Firefox is a free, <strong>Open Source</strong> web browser developed by the Mozilla Foundation and Mozilla Corporation in 2004. The Firefox web browser can be used with Windows, Mac and Linux operating systems, as well as Android and iOS mobile devices. Firefox uses the Google search page as its homepage and default search engine. Firefox is guided by The Mozilla Manifesto, a set of principles the nonprofit Mozilla Foundation developed. Firefox's privacy and open source principles make it a unique web browser. Unlike Apple's Safari and Google Chrome, Firefox does not sell users' personal data to advertisers or to services like Google. Firefox introduced and popularized many of today's standard browser features. When the Firefox browser was first released under the name Mozilla Firefox, it was one of the first browsers to offer a bookmark toolbar and tabbed browsing, which lets users open tabs in the same window and switch back and forth among them. Mozilla Firefox also offered a pop-up blocker and a plugin that let developers add new, downloadable features known as add-ons or browser extensions. In 2016, Firefox announced Firefox Quantum, an update to its search engine that improved user experience and processing power. Quantum transitioned Firefox to a multiprocess architecture that uses less memory with many browser tabs open.</p>

   <h2>What is Firefox Used For?</h2> <p>Firefox is mainly used for browsing the internet like its other modern browser competitors, Chrome and Safari. However, its open source nature enables additional uses that Chrome and Safari do not offer, including the ability for developers to modify the browser, redistribute their own versions and add source code to a code repository that the Mozilla Foundation uses to officially update the browser.</p>
